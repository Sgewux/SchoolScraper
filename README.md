# SchoolScraper

School scraper it's a personal project wich will help me to be up to date with my school's relevant information. Because go to the school's web and read the large list of posts and find the new ones it's too boring, so fuck it, i did it in Python.
To be honest i just did it for fun i won't read my school's relevant information.

## What the hell it's a "circular"?

You'll see the spanish word "circular" a lot of times in the source code, thats because at the date i haven't found a way to say it in english.

i'll fix it if i can find an english word with the same meaning (you can help me if you want)

In a short way a circular it's basically a document with relevant or important information.

## Requirements 

Python3
Requests module
lxml module

If you want to run the program you just have to install this modules on your virtual enviroment or in your local enviroment as well and run itthrough a terminal.

If you have some feedback to me i'll be happy to read it you can find me on twitter with the same username :)
